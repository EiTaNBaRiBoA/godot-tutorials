# [Godot/C#] Tutorials

**Mina Pêcheux - Since November 2022**

<img style="width: 128px" src="doc/godot-small.png" />

This repo contains the code and assets for the various Godot/C# tutorials I published as videos and text articles on YouTube/Medium.

=========================

⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️

I re-updated this repo to work with Godot 4. Tutorials 01 to 05 were initially made with Godot 3 and the video/text versions still refer to this old version, but the code and the assets in this Github repo are made for Godot 4.

=========================

As of now, the repo contains the following tutorials:

## 00. Your first time in Godot?

Curious about the fundamentals of this free open-source game engine? This little tutorial will show you how to install and setup the software, plus how to make a little demo of a bouncy ball with some physics in just 15'! :)
